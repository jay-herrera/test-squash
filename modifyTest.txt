This causes Holden to storm out and leave Pencey for New York City a few days earlier than planned for Holiday break.
Once he arrives in New Jersey, he cannot go home, as his parents do not yet know that he has been expelled.
Instead, he rents a room at the Edmont Hotel, where he witnesses some sexually charged scenes through the windows of other rooms.
His loneliness then causes him to find out human interaction, which he does at the Lavender Room, the hotel’s nightclub.
After interacting with some women there, he goes to another nightclub, only to leave after seeing his elder brother’s ex-chick.
When he gets back to the hotel, he orders a prostitute to his room, only to talk to her.
This situation ends in him being punched in the stomach.
