To what is implied to be a sanatorium, Holden, the narrator and protagonist, tells the story of his adventures before the previous Christmas.
The story begins with Holden at Pencey Prep School on his way to the house of his history teacher, John, so that he can say hello.
He reveals to the reader that he has been expelled for failing most of his classes.
After he visits Spencer, she encounters his roommate, Ward Stradlater, who asks Holden to write an essay for English class for him while he goes on a date with a longtime friend of Holdenâ€™s.
Having agreed, Holden writes about the baseball glove of his younger brother, Allie, who died of cancer.
