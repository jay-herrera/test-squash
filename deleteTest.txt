The next morning, Holden calls Sally Hayes, an ex-girlfriend of his.
They spend the day together until Holden makes a rude remark and she leaves crying.
Holden then meets up with a former schoolmate, Carl Luce, at a bar, but Luce leaves early because he becomes annoyed by Holden’s immature comments.
Holden stays behind and gets drunk by himself.
(Burns’s poem, “Comin thro’ the Rye,”  exists in several versions, but most render the lines as “Gin a body meet a body / Comin thro’ the rye.”)
Soon they hear their parents come home after a night out, and Holden sneaks away. He calls his former English teacher, Mr. Antolini, who tells Holden he can come stay at his apartment.
