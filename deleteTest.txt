The next morning, Holden calls Sally Hayes, an ex-girlfriend of his.
They spend the day together until Holden makes a rude remark and she leaves crying.
Holden then meets up with a former schoolmate, Carl Luce, at a bar, but Luce leaves early because he becomes annoyed by Holden’s immature comments.
Holden stays behind and gets drunk by himself.
After he leaves, he wanders in Central Park until the cold drives him to his family’s apartment.
He sneaks in, still not prepared to face his parents, and finds his 10-year-old sister, Phoebe.
She is upset when she hears that Holden has failed out and accuses him of not liking anything.
It is at this time that Holden describes to his sister his fantasy of being “the catcher in the rye,” which was inspired by a song he heard a little boy singing: “If a body catch a body comin’ through the rye.”
(Burns’s poem, “Comin thro’ the Rye,”  exists in several versions, but most render the lines as “Gin a body meet a body / Comin thro’ the rye.”)
Soon they hear their parents come home after a night out, and Holden sneaks away. He calls his former English teacher, Mr. Antolini, who tells Holden he can come stay at his apartment.
Holden falls asleep on Antolini’s couch and awakes to Antolini stroking his forehead, which Holden interprets as a sexual advance.
